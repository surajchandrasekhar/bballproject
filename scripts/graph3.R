#Create scatter plot That shows players basic defensive stats vs the advanced defensive stats to show if steals or blocks constitutes a good defender
#Create function BuildGraph3 with 3 parameters: the data set, the value of the radio button, and the minimum value
#Create plotly scatter plot with the radio button inputed value in x and defensive box plus-minus as y, with the size of the plot 
#points as the defensive win shares
# display necesssary information when it hovers, such as Player Name, Defensive box-plus minus, defensive win shares, blocks, and steals
# display information such that only players that have more steals or blocks than the slider value will be displayed.
