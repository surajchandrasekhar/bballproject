INFO 201 final group project trying to show correlations between basketball statistics with plotly

In our project, we took the last 10 full NBA seasons worth of data from Basketball Reference, and we are displaying scatter plots looking at various correlations, like Leading scorers versus various efficiency stats, A Team's offensive vs defensive ratings, and a player's block/steal value versus the Defensive Box Plus Minus with the size showing the defensive win shares, a key advanced statistic to show a player's defensive value. Here is the link to our shiny app.
